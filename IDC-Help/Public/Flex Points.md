### What are flex points?

Each FTE gets 15,000 “flex points” every year, which can be used to increase the default insurance coverage on the Benefits Asia portal. Flex points for new employees are pro-rated according to how many months are left in the MS Calendar year at the date of their joining.

### What can you do with flex points?

Employees can add additional family members to their insurance or increase coverage amount.

If you don't want additional cover or have points left over after making your selections, use the remaining flex points to top up your [[India Perks+]] benefit on the enrollment page. Each flex point put towards the India Perks+ benefit increases the amount reimbursable for the year by Re. 1.

### Allocating flex points

Flex points can be allocated when a new employee joins, or during a set time of the year for other employees. You will receive an email with exact steps. Any unused points will expire end of FY.
