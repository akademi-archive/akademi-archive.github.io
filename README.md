# MicroWiki

MicroWiki is based on Jekyll Garden v 0.4! Jekyll Garden is a Jekyll theme that lets you publish your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault (or a subset of it) as a Jekyll static website. The theme is markdown and Obsidian setup friendly. You can use your own server or Github page to set up your SSG. Check out the demo.
