Employees receive stock via [Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP)] or via [Employee Stock Purchase Program [ESPP]].

### ESOP

ESOPs are declared under Stock Vest Perquisite in Annexure for Form 16 Part B that Microsoft gives to employees. So the income tax for ESOPs is automatically paid via salary deductions. However, since Microsoft stock is a foreign asset, this must be separately declared in your Income Tax returns under Schedule FA, and this doesn't happen automatically. You have to declare your ownership of these stocks even if you haven't sold any and don't have a profit on them.

### Claiming foreign tax credit on Microsoft dividends

Holding Microsoft stock means that you get paid dividends on the stocks. Some tax is witheld by the US government on these dividends. 

These dividends should be declared as income from other sources in the year they are paid, and the assessee must pay the applicable tax on dividends. Dividends are taxable in the year they are earned, regardless of whether they are remitted to India or not. You can claim this tax as a deduction while filing your Income-tax Return in India to avoid double taxation.

You can, however, claim Foreign Tax Credit in India and get this back. You should receive a hard copy of US Form 1042s sent to your home address, and you need to upload it as proof while filling Form 67 in your ITR.

### **Are there any consequences if I do not report my US shareholdings?**

Failing to report or reporting inaccurately can result in additional taxes and penalties under the Black Money Act. The penalty can be as high as Rs. 10 lakhs annually. For any undisclosed income will bear a tax of 30% and a penalty of up to 90%.
