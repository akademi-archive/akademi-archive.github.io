## Flex Points – Benefits Asia

[User Login (benefitsasia.com)](https://ap.benefitsasia.com/v1/microsoftin/BA2Login/tabid/1164/Default.aspx "https://ap.benefitsasia.com/v1/microsoftin/ba2login/tabid/1164/default.aspx") 

You get 15,000 “flex points”, which can be used to bump up your insurance policy (you can add family members or increase coverage amount). Whatever points you have left after making your decision you should put into topping up the India Perks+ benefit on the enrollment page (won't happen automatically) and any unused points will expire end of FY.

Go to “Start Enrollment” to pick the options you want.
